#Blog - Frontend

[http://david.veli.la/blog](http://david.veli.la/blog/)

My personal blog, which detects new logbook entries in my repositories and publishes posts automatically (yes, I'm lazy like that, I'm a developer not a blogger).

**Tech Stack**

	Angular JS
	JSON driven posts
	jQuery
	Materialize.css
	a simple but cute CSS animation

**Usage**

*NO BACKEND*

If you want to try Angular without external services interaction. (Post samples come from json/posts.json)

	1- git checkout backend/none
	2- Open the root with your browser [it still requires a web server of your choice].

*BACKEND IN PYTHON*

You need a web server with Python support.

	Python API in a [separate repository](https://github.com/david-v/blog-backend) [Working on it]
