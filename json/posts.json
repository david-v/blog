I've deployed the app to: <a target='_blank' href='https://plaza-mayor.appspot.com/towns/Segura'>https://plaza-mayor.appspot.com/towns/Segura</a></br></br>It was quite difficult to make this run. A lot harder than Google's 5 min tutorial to deploy a Hello World Servlet with no framework. I had to downgrade to JDK 7. Then use Jetty instead of Tomcat, so I had to learn it too, that and configure Intellij. It also required changes in the codebase: cache, logging system. But probably the worst was a <a target='_blank' href='https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-13829'>BUG in my version of Spring: 4.2.4</a> that makes GAE not run. I had to downgrade to 4.1.3</br></br>It's pretty nice that Google's implementation of a SQL database is MySQL (could have been anything else!) so it still works with the JDBC Dialects that I had configured, at least I didn't have to change that... I can now go to bed knowing that I just gave birth to a proper web service to find towns in Spain. I'll think of what to do with it tomorrow.",
